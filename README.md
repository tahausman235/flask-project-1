**LAB 8 Project**

I made a flask project first time

The Gym Management System is a responsive web application designed to streamline gym operations. It allows users to register, log in, and view membership plans, schedules, and trainers. Admin functionality can also be simulated for managing gym members and schedules.

This project is built using Flask, HTML and CSS
